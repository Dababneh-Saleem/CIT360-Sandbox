                        <p>
                            This page of my site will walk you through my family history.  I am one of five boys born to Kitty & Talal Dababneh.  My mother's <br/>
                            family line comes from Ireland and Scotland.  My father's family line comes from Jordan.  Below you will find images of the <br />
                            family tree information I have for each side of my family.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Murray - Ross Family Tree</h3>
                        <p>
                            Here below is the family tree for my mother's side of the family.  My Grandmother on my mother's side had two orphans for parents,<br/>
                            tracking their history down has been very difficult because they came from Ireland & Scotland.  The orphanage in Ireland suffered<br/>
                            a tragic fire many years ago and all parental records, birth records etc. were lost.  The orphanage in Scotland simply did not have<br/>
                            any records for the children who had been raised there.  <br/>

                        <h3>Dababneh Family Tree</h3>
                        <p>
                            Here below is the family tree for my father's side of the family.  My father was born and raised in the middle-east in Jordan.  The<br/>
                            records were maintained by the church.  Of particular note is that the Dababneh family was Catholic, a rare thing in that region of<br/>
                            the world.  A few years ago my father pulled out this 18x24 document showing the entire family tree dating back to the seventeen-hundreds,<br/>
                            I was floored. It is all in arabic and unfortunately, it only contains the names of the men, no women were recorded. I've placed a small<br/>
                            red circle around my name as it appears on the tree.  I am working with my father to create a document listing the women of the family.<br />
