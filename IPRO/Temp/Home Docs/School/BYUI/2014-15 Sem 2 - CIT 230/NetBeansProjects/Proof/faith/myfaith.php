                        <h1>My Faith</h1>
                            <p>
                                My faith has been a significant factor in my life, without it I know that I could not have been so successful in navigating the trials of my<br />
                                life.  As I look back on where I have been and what I have been through I am reminded of how closely God's hand has been guiding my life.<br />
                                <br />
                                I was raised by a very faithful mother who made sure that we not only attended church every Sunday, but that we served in the church as well.<br />
                                From as early as we could we all were given the opportunity to serve as Alter Boys at church.  We attended Holy Rosary church from as far back<br />
                                as I can remember.  When we lived in Detroit we attended Holy Redeemer church and my brothers also attended school there before we moved <br />
                                to Canada.  In Canada, we attended Holy Rosary school even though it was 5 miles further from our home than the local public school.<br />
                                <br />
                                We were taught about Jesus Christ at school and at church which was a real blessing.  I was able to study the life of Christ from the Bible<br />
                                during the school week and then see and hear the priest relate those stories to our daily lives.  We had a really nice priest for many years<br />
                                named Father Hennessey.  He was a very kind old man and he was always so happy to see us. While some found him to be older and not as hip, I <br />
                                really payed close attention when he spoke and I learned much from him.  The church brought in a more energetic priest, a priest who was easily<br />
                                30 years younger than Father Hennessey.  I liked him as well and he was a great story teller, also comparing the parables of the Bible to our day<br />
                                but I didn't feel that he was as sincere as Father Hennessey.  I still listened and pondered the things shared but I found that I preferred mass <br />
                                when Father Hennessey was leading.  <br />
                                <br />
                                After a few years at Holy Rosary school I moved on to St.Mary's (you can read about this in the 'Education & Career' section of the site) and was <br />
                                provided a great opportunity to learn how to sing and perform.  My favorite pieces that we studied were the songs of faith.  I always felt so much<br />
                                closer to Heaven when we sang, especially when we got to sing in the Cathedral where the sound resonated so beautifully. It was this music that<br />
                                helped me through some of the harder times in my life and I will be forever grateful that I had this great experience at St.Mary's. My experience<br />
                                here lead me to decide to attend Regina Mundi High School where I continued to learn more about the life of the Savior.  <br />
                                <br />
                                One semester, during my sophomore year of high school, we were given a semester wide study assignment to study different religions of the world. I <br />
                                put a lot of time and effort into this assignment and researched several different faiths.  I had a real desire to know God and to know how I could <br />
                                best live the way He would expect me to.  At the end of the school year I was awarded with a school-wide award, the Religious Studies Award for my<br />
                                work.  This acknowledgment and recognition drove me to continue to pursue this research on my own throughout the summer and into the next year. It was<br />
                                during the course of the next school year that I met a friend who was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  He was the only<br />
                                guy in our entire high school of his faith but somehow we crossed-paths and this altered the course of my life forever.  <br />
                                <br />
                                Through my own studies and prayer about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints I came to a better understanding of my purpose in this life<br />
                                and of God's plan for all of His children.  I chose to be baptized six months after my sixteenth birthday in the same manner that Christ was, by <br />
                                full immersion.  I have come to know for myself that God does indeed live, that He loves each and everyone of us and that He has prepared a way, <br />
                                through Christ our Savior, for us to return to live with Him someday.  I have also come to know for myself, through the Holy Ghost, that I can be <br />
                                with my family, even after death, as a family unit, that death does not break the eternal bonds of marriage nor does it take away our rights and <br />
                                privileges as families.  I know that it is by His infinite wisdom that we are all here on this earth, to learn to choose for ourselves to follow <br />
                                His ways, to better ourselves and to claim the blessings of the Atonement of Christ through choosing to follow His gospel and His ways.  <br />
                                <br />
                                My life has been greatly blessed through receiving my own personal witness of these things and it is by the strength of that personal witness that<br />
                                I can do everything I do. If I can leave anything to my family and loved ones it would be the knowledge I have received from my life journey that <br />
                                lead me to this personal testimony.<br />
