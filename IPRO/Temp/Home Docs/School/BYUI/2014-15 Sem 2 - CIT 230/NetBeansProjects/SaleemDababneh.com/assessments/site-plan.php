                                that will allow me to define, through various multi-media, my past life experiences such as places I have 
                                lived, family history, fun-facts and notable events. The end goal being a more dynamic version of a journal

                                as well as to share stories of struggles encountered. The site will also be used to give details regarding 
                                life events such as moves, educational history, and employment history.

                            <h3>Site Color Scheme</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="../images/site_color_scheme.png" alt="Site Color Scheme" title="Site Color Scheme" /><br />
                                HEX: B28158 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                                | HEX: FF9640 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                                | HEX: FF831C  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                                | HEX:41A1B2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                                <br />
                                Color will be used primarily in the header box that will span the width of the page and make up the navigation 
                                panel and title box.  There will also be a use of white-space in the main regions for ease of reading.  
                                Text colors will be black unless a background color is used for a specific section, then white would be used. 
                                Photos will be strategically placed in a position of unison with the related text on the relative page so as 
                                to aid in the flow of viewing and navigation.  <br />
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <h3>Typography</h3>
                            <p>
                                Typography Selections - Target Areas for use<br />
                                <br />
                                Arial, Verdana, sans-serif - General written text, sub-headings<br />
                                Lovelo Black, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif - Headings, Titles, navigation links<br />
                                Lovelo Black, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif – ALL CAPS	MENU ITEMS<br />
                                <br />
                                In addition to the above selected fonts, I will use varying levels of font size in the menus, links, headings 
                                and text but I will keep to limited color contrasts in text font to keep the text clear and to avoid distractions.
                                Font sizes will be set at a 16 point font but will scale by percentages of up to 175% and down to 90%.  <br />
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <h3>Navigation</h3>
                            <p>
                                Navigation will flow from top left to bottom right.  The main text of any given page will be left-aligned but may 
                                shift to either side to allow for a joining flow from related photos.  The top of each page will include a colored 
                                header containing a family photo that will act as a 'Home Page' link.  The main body of text will have images 
                                scattered throughout.  All primary links will be found on the top, center portion of the site and the bottom 
                                of the site will contain links for secondary links such as site plan, contact info etc.  <br />
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <h3>Responsive Layouts</h3>
                            <p>
                                The site will be built in HTML5 to auto-adjust to the varying forms of devices that will be used to view the pages.  
                                Images will shift in size and placement accordingly.  Videos that are posted will also include links so that devices 
                                that cannot play video in the site could still be used with a reference to the video link.<br />
