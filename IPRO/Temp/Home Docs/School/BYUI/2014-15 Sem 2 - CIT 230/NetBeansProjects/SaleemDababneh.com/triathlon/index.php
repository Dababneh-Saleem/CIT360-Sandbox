                                The Prison Breakout Triathlon is a Prison to Prison race event pitting participants against the challenge 
                                of escaping the historic prisons of the Bay Area.  San Quentin prison is a maximum security California state prison 
                                near San Rafael. Alcatraz Prison was a maximum-security federal prison, located on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco 
                                bay that closed in 1963. This particular race will be near Half Ironman, consisting of: a run of roughly 16 miles, 
                                a challenging swim of 3 miles and a scenic cycling course of 25 miles.

                            <p>
                                The cost to enter is $100. The race will begin near San Quentin, run to Fisherman's wharf, swim to Alcatraz island 
                                and back and then bike around San Francisco bay, crossing the John T. Knox freeway and 
                                ending where the race began. This is a race between historic locales and unique in its scope.
