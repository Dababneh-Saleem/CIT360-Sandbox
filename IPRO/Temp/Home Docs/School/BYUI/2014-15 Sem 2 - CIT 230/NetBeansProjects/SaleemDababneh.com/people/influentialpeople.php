                            <p>
                                I'd like to introduce you to few people who are not blood relatives of mine but have had a significant impact on 
                                my life.  These people have helped me along my way in school, work and overall in life.  While this page only shows
                                those who are not blood relatives I must give credit to my mother, wife and mother-in-law for also being key
                                influences in my life.  
                            </p>

                                    Rob and I met during our senior year of high school, I was the new kid in town and he was hands down 
                                    one of the most popular guys in school.  He knew everyone by name, was a stellar athlete and also a 
                                    solid student.  He could be real serious or real goofy, he has a big heart but didn't let others push him around.  
                                    He knows what he wants and he works his butt off to get it.  Rob and I started to hang around each other 
                                    when we were both asked to participate in a contest called the 'Mr. Wonderful' contest.  It was a light-hearted 
                                    fund-raising event for the school in which a dozen male seniors would dance and parade around on stage in a 
                                    beauty competition.  We had a blast doing this and ended up finding that we had many similar interests.  
                                    Rob and I had some great times together but we also helped strengthen each other during some very 
                                    challenging times.  Rob and I became a close to blood brothers as humanely possible and that bond has 
                                    remains strong despite us living many miles apart.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Rob's family invited me to live with them after I had moved out on my own.  I was hesitant at first but Rob
                                    convinced me that it would be ok to live with them.  Rob and I shared the basement of the Lundell home with 
                                    another friend, Jon who had been given a place to stay by the Lundell's as well due to some difficulties in his
                                    home life.  The three of us had some amazingly fun times but also helped life each other up during hard times.  
                                    As one might expect with a true friend, Rob sought nothing in return for all of his generosity, he simply 
                                    followed the example of his parents in lifting everyone in his life up as much as he could.

                                    Gail Lundell is Rob's mom, she was a crucial influence in my late teen years and is responsible 
                                    for drawing out my abilities to thrive as an adult.  She continues to provide support even though many 
                                    miles keep us apart these days.  Her great example of unconditional love is one that will stick with me 
                                    for the rest of my life.  She taught me many life lessons and always pushed me to solve my own problems
                                    while never making me feel like I had to do it all by myself.

                                    Dave Tiller hired me as a document copy sales rep back in 2002.  When I first worked for him I found him
                                    to be intimidating yet fair.  Dave seemed to have a knack for getting the most out of me and he helped me 
                                    to leverage my potential beyond my initial role.  Despite being successful in sales, I sought out 
                                    opportunities to move into the technology operations.  Even though this didn't jive with the best interests 
                                    of the company, Dave listened to me and helped me achieve my goals while also making sure my efforts helped 
                                    our company too.  <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Dave is the type of leader anyone would want to work for, he 
                                    truly cares about his team and he leads by example.  Even after moving on to different employers Dave has
                                    continued to be a mentor to me, offering advice, counsel and motivation even when my path took me to a 
                                    competitor.  Dave never let our professional competition interfere with his willingness to mentor and guide 
                                    me.  My career has soared beyond anything I could have imagined and much of this is owed to Dave and his
                                    ability to see in me what I could not.  I consider Dave a life-long friend and feel blessed to have had him
                                    in my life.
