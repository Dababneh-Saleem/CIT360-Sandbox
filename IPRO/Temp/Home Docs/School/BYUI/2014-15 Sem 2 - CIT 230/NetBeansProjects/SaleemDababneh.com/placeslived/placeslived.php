                                Here is a video slide-show of the homes that I lived in during my life. I was born in the United States, 
                                in Detroit, MI and lived there until I was 4 years old.  At that point in my life our family moved to London, 
                                Ontario, Canada which is a two hours drive from Detroit.  We moved there as 'Landed Immigrants' for my father's 
                                work so we kept our US Citizenship.  When I left home in my teens this would prove beneficial as I was able to 
                                move back to the United States on my own.  I lived in Arizona from the age of 17 up until 2013 when we relocated 
                                to Texas for my work.
