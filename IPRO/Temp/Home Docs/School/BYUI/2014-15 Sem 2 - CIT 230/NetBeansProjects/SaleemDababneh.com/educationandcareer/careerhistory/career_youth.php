                            <h5>LONDON FREE PRESS</h5>
                            <p>
                                I got my start as a paper boy when I was only 8 years old.  I was too young to legally work in Canada but my mom let me sign up for a paper 
                                route under my older brother's name so I could do it.  I would deliver the London Free Press paper each morning before going to school.  The 
                                papers would get dropped off by a van at ~6am each day and I would wake up, walk about a block to the drop point and then load up my paper 
                                cart. I was responsible for delivering the paper to my immediate neighborhood and the one next to us.  There were about 150 houses in total that I 
                                would walk up to and place a paper at their door each day.  I had to go quickly as I needed to be home by 7am so that I could get ready for 
                                school.  I delivered papers for the London Free Press from the time I was 8 until I was 15.  The pay wasn't the greatest but it was steady 
                                work and that kept me motivated.  
                                <br /><br />
                                Now delivering papers may sound like an easy job but just picture doing this in Canada.  Sometimes the temperatures in the morning were well
                                below freezing and the snow on the sidewalks wasn't plowed like the streets were.  It was a great workout somedays trying to pull that cart 
                                through a few feet of snow, 150 newspapers stacked high.  There were a few times that my mom came and helped me which was always great when
                                she could. When the paycheck would show up in my brother's name, my mom would go cash it and put it into my bank account for me.
                                <br /><br />
                                I learned quite a few life lessons from that first job.  I learned to manage my own schedule, I couldn't stay up too late or I would be too 
                                tired in the morning to get up.  I learned to fight on when things get tough, there were somedays when I would get so tired from sloshing 
                                through the snow to deliver the papers that I felt like I couldn't go on, sometimes I would just stop and cry but realize that I had to 
                                keep moving because there wasn't anyone working with me to help (except for those times that mom came out).  I realized that I was much 
                                more capable then I thought I was and this lesson has continued to serve me well throughout my life.  
                                <br /><br />

                            <h5>FOOT LOCKER</h5>
                            <p>
                                When I was old enough to get a full-time job I set out and put in applications at several places near our home.  I was hoping for something
                                with a little better pay, more learning opportunities and something indoors!  I landed my first 'real' job at Footlocker.  I was pretty excited
                                about this opportunity as I was very into sports by this point in my life.  I was hired as a store associate for the mall location near our 
                                home.  It was a pretty decent gig, I got to wear a super cool stripped shirt that made me look like a referee, got to buy sport shoes at a 
                                discount and basically helped other people pick out some new shoes.  It was pretty much a win-win situation all around.  Most people already
                                knew what they were wanting, it was my job to help them out...oh and to make sure to upsell them some add-on items like socks, weather-proofing
                                spray, hats and more.  I would show up for work right after school and work until closing time during the week, on Saturdays I would work from 
                                open until close.  After what seems like only a few weeks I was given the 'keys' to the store and management entrusted me with closing duties.
                                I would have to validate all of the receipts, check the register, update the books and then lock-up the store.  I worked here until I moved
                                to the United States a few years later.  
                                <br /><br />
                                
                            </p>
                            <h5>AG SERVICES / PIZZA HUT / SUBWAY</h5>
                            <p>
                                When I arrived in the United States I was 17 years old and entering my senior year of high school.  I was on my own at this point in my life
                                so I had to make sure I had enough money to pay the bills.  I took three part-time jobs so that I could make enough money working at odd hours.
                                Each morning before school I would set out at 5am to AG Services, a Agricultural company to pull field samples from the cotton fields.  This involved
                                driving out to various farms around the southeast part of the Phoenix metro area in Arizona, jumping out of my vehicle and running through fields
                                pulling sample stems in a diagonal run-through of each section.  After I had collected the samples I would drop off the samples at a lab and 
                                then head home to get cleaned-up for school.  The fields were often wet from irrigation so my shoes would pick up a bunch of muck which then
                                turned into a struggle to even lift my feet, a great morning work-out is the way I looked at it.
                                <br /><br />
                                
                                Each evening I would then head to my job at Pizza Hut where I started out making pizza and running the register, then moved into the lucrative
                                side of the business...delivery.  I would drive all over the Gilbert, AZ area delivering pizza, wings and drinks until midnight and then head home
                                to catch some shut-eye.  It was a fast-paced environment and I did well there because I was able to learn all aspects of the business quickly. After
                                working there for only a month I was approached by another company who wanted me to come work for them.  Through this new opportunity I earned the 
                                distinguished title of 'Sandwich Artist'.  It was a fun job, the manager met me when I was working at Pizza Hut across the street and offered me a 
                                more competitive wage, a whopping $0.25 more per hour.  I negotiated with her to work the early-evenings so that I could keep working delivery for 
                                Pizza Hut at night.  I made subs during the dinner rush, cleaned up afterwards and then I would prep everything for the next morning and then head 
                                back over to Pizza Hut to run the evening deliveries from 8pm-12am.  I did this all until I left for my mission in London, England.

                            <h5>COSTCO</h5>
                            <p>
                                After returning from the mission field I took a 'seasonal' opportunity with Costco.  I was hired to work in the Photo Lab during the Christmas
                                season.  I was told when I got the job that it was only for the season and not to expect anything further.  I took the job understanding this was to
                                be short-term but I kept looking for a full-time opportunity.  I figured the short-term infusion of cash couldn't hurt while on the job hunt and the 
                                hours they wanted me to work didn't conflict with my search.  I was pleasantly surprised when, at the end of the Christmas season, they offered me a full-time
                                position.  I couldn't say no, it was a great work environment, the hours were much more reasonable and I could make good money too.  The only catch was
                                that the Photo Lab was already staffed well enough for the regular seasons so I took a position working as a Costco gas attendant.  Not a bad gig at all.
                               <br /><br /> 
                               I worked the Costco location in North Scottsdale, AZ. I was told it was the busiest location in the state and after only a day out there working the gas
                               station I could see that this was no joke.  The pumps opened at 9am but the lines started forming around the block about 20-30 minutes before that.  It was
                               busy from open until close every day.  I had to work to ensure the pumps stayed active, I had to direct traffic, clean up spills and then help the gas 
                               delivery trucks with the refill of the massive tanks twice each day.  The team I worked with out there was a fun group of guys, the weather in Arizona
                               was never cold either so I had little to complain about.  Even in the hot summer months, I would simply stay in the shade as much as possible, greet 
                               the Costco members as they pulled up and would occasionally have to help some of our more senior guests pump their gas. I was attending Scottsdale 
                               Community College at the time and was interested in pursuing a technology degree.  I worked here for a year, until a friend of mine told me about an 
                               opporutnity to work for IBM and I jumped at the chance.  
                                <br /><br />
                            </p>
                            <h5>IBM</h5>
                            <p>
                                My first real, corporate job (in my opinion) was here at IBM.  I worked in a call center handling tech support calls.  I loved this job and my boss
                                seemed to think I had a knack for dealing with customers.  I would field calls from clients who needed help with their computers and I did my best to 
                                be patient and kind. I had learned on my mission how to quickly connect with complete strangers and this served me well in this environment.  After only
                                three months in this position, the customer service director asked me to start training others.  A few of the sales managers at IBM started to recruit me to 
                                get into sales.  I resisted at first but they persisted and kept talking up the earning opportunity.  I decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did. I had great 
                                success in this role, I sought out some of the largest companies in the country that others had given up on and somehow I earned their trust and their business.
                                After only a year in this role I had secured new business from the NYSE, NASDAQ, Barclays Bank and several other international banks.  I was doing great 
                                and making really good money for someone who didn't have a college degree. This all lead to a an unforgettable event that reshaped my whole career, 9/11.
                                <br /><br />
                                When the World Trade centers were struck on 9/11 life for me changed dramatically at work.  I still remember that day as though it were only yesterday.  I 
                                had woke up early to wait for my car-pool buddy to arrive.  I don't know why but I woke up earlier than I normally did on that day and since I was waiting 
                                around I decided to turn on the TV.  It was everywhere, news of the horrific terrorist attack on our nation.  The clients I worked with were all in what was 
                                known as Area 2, the financial district of NY.  As we drove to work that day I felt sick to my stomach as I wondered how my clients/friends were doing in NY.
                                As soon as we arrived at work I found that the company had rolled out TVs in front of the main work area so everyone could watch the news.  Having a Arabic 
                                name at this point in my life lead to some difficulties in my job both with co-workers and with clients. I won't get into the dirty details but this eventually
                                lead to me leaving this job at IBM and moving on to the companies you'll find listed in my 'professional resume' section of this site.
