                            <h4>
                                Born of necessity, perhaps even political expediency, Alcatraz represents the federal government's 
                                response to post-Prohibition, post-Depression America. Both the institution and the men confined 
                                within its walls are a part of this era, and in order to be studied with any degree of understanding, 
                                it must be attended to with a focus on this time period. Prisons are a reflection of society and the 
                                reflection offered by Alcatraz is one of great clarity. <br />
                                <br />
                                The collaborative effort of attorney general Homer Cummings and Director of the Bureau of Prisons, 
                                Sanford Bates, produced a legendary prison that seemed both necessary and appropriate to the times. 
                                The emergence of persistent assertions about J. Edgar Hoover's interest and influence with regard to 
                                Alcatraz cannot be corroborated, but neither have they been completely denied. With the public peace 
                                constantly threatened by crime, a response had to be made and Alcatraz was that response. <br />
                                <br />
                                An in-house memo issued by Cummings shortly after taking office addressed the subject of creating a 
                                special prison for kidnapers, racketeers, and individuals guilty of predatory crimes. A remote site 
                                was sought, one that would prohibit constant communication with the outside world by those confined 
                                within its walls. Although land in Alaska was being considered, the availability of Alcatraz Island 
                                conveniently coincided with the government's perceived need for a super-prison. <br />
                                <br />
                                Having taken possession of the former Army prison and having circumvented the San Francisco citizens 
                                who were concerned at the prospect of vicious criminals in the near vicinity, the Bureau of Prisons 
                                set about selecting a warden who could do the job. A well-organized, no-nonsense businessman and 
                                prison administrator with twelve years of experience in the California Department of Corrections, 
                                James A. Johnston was to be that man. Johnston had retired at the time of his appointment by the 
                                Department of Justice, and its acceptance resulted in his serving as warden of Alcatraz for the 
                                next fourteen years.<br />
                                <br />
                                Classified as a concentration model, where difficult-to-manage prisoners from other institutions 
                                would be concentrated under one roof, Alcatraz served as an experiment. Segregation on this scale 
                                had not before been practiced, and only time would indicate its success or failure. Warden Johnston 
                                and the second Director of the Bureau of Prisons, James V. Bennett, both were men well ahead of their 
                                time. Visionaries in the field of penology, their knowledge enabled Alcatraz to function as it had 
                                been hoped and to serve later as a model for the federal prison located in Marion, Illinois.<br />

                                The San Quentin prison is situated on prime real estate overlooking the San Francisco Bay. The facility is almost 
                                150 years old and some would like to see it retired and the land used for housing. Others would like to see the 
                                prison turned into a historic site and made untouchable by developers. Even though this prison may eventually close, 
                                it will always remain a colorful part of California's, and America's, past.<br />
                                <br />
                                The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill on January 24, 1848 impacted all aspects of life in California. The 
                                gold meant a great influx of new people to the region. Unfortunately, the gold rush also brought a number 
                                of unsavory people. Many of these would eventually require incarceration. These circumstances led to the 
                                creation of one of the most famous prisons in the nation.<br />
                                <br />
                                Before a permanent prison facility was erected in California, convicts were housed on prison ships. The 
                                use of prison ships as a means to hold those guilty of crimes was not new to the penitentiary system. The 
                                British held many patriots on prison ships during the American Revolution. Even years after numerous permanent 
                                facilities existed, this practice continued in a more tragic fashion during World War II. The Japanese 
                                transported a number of prisoners in merchant vessels that were unfortunately the targets of many allied naval 
                                ships. <br />
                                <br />
                                Before San Quentin was built on the outskirts of San Francisco, the prisoners were kept on prison ships such 
                                as the "Waban." The California legal system decided to create a more permanent structure because of overcrowding 
                                and frequent escapes aboard the ship. They chose Point San Quentin and purchased 20 acres of land to begin what 
                                would become the state's oldest prison: San Quentin. The construction of the facility began in 1852 with the 
                                use of prison labor and ended in 1854. The prison has had a storied past and continues to operate today. <br />

                                The prison is situated on prime real estate overlooking the San Francisco Bay. The facility is almost 150 years 
                                old and some would like to see it retired and the land used for housing. Others would like to see the prison 
                                turned into a historic site and made untouchable by developers. Even though this prison may eventually close, 
                                it will always remain a colorful part of California's, and America's, past. <br />
