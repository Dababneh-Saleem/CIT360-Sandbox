                        <p>
                            This page of my site will walk you through my family history.  I am one of five boys born to Kitty & Talal Dababneh.  My mother's 
                            family line comes from Ireland and Scotland.  My father's family line comes from Jordan.  Below you will find images of the 
                            family tree information I have for each side of my family.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Murray - Ross Family Tree</h3>
                        <p>
                            Here below is the family tree for my mother's side of the family.  My Grandmother on my mother's side had two orphans for parents,
                            tracking their history down has been very difficult because they came from Ireland & Scotland.  The orphanage in Ireland suffered
                            a tragic fire many years ago and all parental records, birth records etc. were lost.  The orphanage in Scotland simply did not have
                            any records for the children who had been raised there.  My mother has spent countless hours attempting to piece this puzzle together, 
                            traveling the world to find anything she could.<br/>

                        <h3>Dababneh Family Tree</h3>
                        <p>
                            Here below is the family tree for my father's side of the family.  My father was born and raised in the middle-east in Jordan.  The
                            records were maintained by the church.  Of particular note is that the Dababneh family was Catholic, a rare thing in that region of
                            the world.  A few years ago my father pulled out this 18x24 document showing the entire family tree dating back to the seventeen-hundreds,
                            I was floored. It is all in arabic and unfortunately, it only contains the names of the men, no women were recorded. I've placed a small
                            red circle around my name as it appears on the tree.  I am working with my father to create a document listing the women of the family.<br />
